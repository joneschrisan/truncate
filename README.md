## Change log

truncate [string]
```

### String

The filename to read

## Required Perl Modules

---

## Installing

### Linux

**Native command already exists.**

### Windows

This may sound funny but install perl first. Windows does not come with perl installed as standard.

You can get perl by going to [https://www.perl.org/get.html](https://www.perl.org/get.html)

Put file in a standard location and add that location to the PATH variable.

You may have to add the ".pl" extention to the PATHEXT variable.

Ready to use.

### MAC

Move into '/usr/bin' and remove ext
```
$ cp truncate.pl /usr/bin/truncate
```

Change permissions and owner
```
$ chmod 755 /usr/bin/truncate
$ sudo chown root:wheel /usr/bin/truncate
```

Ready to use.
